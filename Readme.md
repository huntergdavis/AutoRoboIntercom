AutoRoboIntercom 
Initial Commit Hunter Davis March 2014

Just a quick auto-discovery intercom system using text-to-speech and speech-to-text.  

Notes:
1.  I will likely update to include actual audio or video streams at some point.

2. 
 If your Android device is running JellyBean or above:
 Go to Settings -> Language & Input -> Voice Search and download the offline speech recognition pack.
